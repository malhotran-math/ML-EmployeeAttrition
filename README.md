ML project on analysis of factors affecting employee attrition. The goal is to test various ML algorithms and parameter testing methods.

Preliminary:
1. Using pandas to read and pre-process csv files as dataframes and using one-hot to represent data as vectors.
2. Implementing a data stratification (sparse dataframe due to low "yes" attrition factors), improving efficieny.
3. (after running models) Comparing model efficiencies. 

Models:
1. Implementing a random forest classifier algorithm. (pickle)dumping the trained dataset and predicting results for the test set. Concluding with hyper-parameter tuning.
2. ExtraTrees classifier and hyper-parameter tuning.
3. Running a kNN (k-nearest neighbour algo) for range of k, and determining the value of best k.
4. SVM model and hyper parameter tuning.
5. Logistic regression model
6. Gaussian Naive Bayes method
